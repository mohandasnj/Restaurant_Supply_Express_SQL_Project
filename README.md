This is a database app we created using HTML for the front-end and Python (Flask) for the backend. We used SQLAlchemy for the MySQL connection. Although SQLAlchemy is an ORM tool, we didn't any ORM features and only used our raw SQL queries as per the project specifications.

The work was distributed as follows:

Sri: Worked on connecting sql to flask backend and add sql procedures, adding html elements and testing

Sujay: Worked on display of views from the database and built the overall UI

Sanjay: Worked on miscellaneous sql procedures, adding html elements and testing

Suraj: Worked on remove sql procedures, adding html elements and testing
